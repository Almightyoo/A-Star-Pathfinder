This project empowers you with the A* pathfinding algorithm, a powerful tool for navigating complex environments, implemented within the Unity game engine.

Effortlessly Find the Shortest Path:

A Efficiency:* Leverage the A* algorithm's renowned ability to calculate the optimal path between a designated starting point and a target location within your maze.
Collision Awareness: Seamlessly integrate with Unity's collision detection system. Walls are identified through a designated "Unwalkable" layer, ensuring the pathfinding intelligently avoids obstacles.
